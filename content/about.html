            <h2>What is Parenting-ASD?</h2>
            <br><br>
            <h3> Parenting-ASD is a free social network that makes it easy for you to:
                <br><br>
                <ul>

                    <li>get the emotional support you need from others like you, and </li>

                    <li>gain practical advice and insights on managing treatment or therapies for autism
                    </li>

                </ul>
                <br> When you or a loved one are first diagnosed, it's not uncommon to feel alone and uncertain of where to find the best information and people that can help you now. We believe in making it easy to find the best people around you to
                help you get the answers you need, and to find support from people who can truly relate. The main currency on our site is trust – the more you share in posts and your stories, the more questions you ask and answer, the more your support
                will be valued by other members.
                <br><br> Parenting-ASD is a social network where you can truly connect, make real friendships, and share daily ups and downs in a judgment-free place.
                <br><br> Below are the most popular areas of the site:
                <br><br> Home page is where everyone posts updates – including images, stories, thoughts and anecdotes. It's where daily triumphs and trials are shared and supported. Find People Like You based on location, your diagnosis, and age. You
                can browse everyone's story and updates, which helps provide insight as you share with others. Q & A section enables you to search previously asked questions and answers, and gives you the ability to ask your own question that will be
                answered by others on Parenting-ASD. The spirit of the site is to foster a welcoming community with open arms. Maintaining an atmosphere free of judgment and drama is very important to us to make sure every member can share their experiences,
                thoughts and feelings as openly as they wish. All of our members share compassion and deep empathy for each other's journey. When signing up, many people feel shy at first, but quickly discover new friends and people who truly understand
                what you're going through. Once you begin interacting on the site by posting updates, or sharing your story, even answering other's questions, you’ll quickly feel embraced and accepted by the team of individuals already on the site, who
                are, by all measures, strangers, yet feel closer than well-intentioned friends and family.
                <br><br> Who am I? Who sees your information? I am a web developer, with a degree in psychopedagogy and I am the mother of a little girl diagnosed with autism. All of the features on the site are designed with one goal in mind; to connect
                you with others who have been in your shoes.
                <br><br> Parenting-ASD should not only provide you emotional support through the social network, but also be a resource for practical tips, personal experiences, and even referrals to other great doctors from the community. Information
                shared on the site can be seen by everyone who signs up for an account. You can share as much or as little as you like.
                <br><br> I will always respect and protect your privacy. I take this very seriously.
                <br><br> If you ever have any concerns or questions, I can always be reached at contact@lauraciocalau.com.
